                <h2>Evaluation</h2>

                <p>The following rubric reflects the student’s work through the whole creative process of this WebQuest project. The rubric below is separated into four levels of achievement instead of a point or percentage system. To determine the student’s final grade, the teacher averages out the different levels of achievement attained. For example, if on the rubric the student falls on a 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, the student’s final grade would be a 3 because there are more 3s obtained. In the end, the teacher uses their professional judgement to justify the grade.</p>

                <p>Percentages were added to assist teachers in understanding the meaning of each level of achievement.
                </p>

                <p>Typically, with appropriate support, all students should be able to achieve grade-level expectations.
