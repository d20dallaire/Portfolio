                <h3>2. Define Creativity</h3>

                <p>Using the new knowledge acquired through your research, come up with an in-depth personal definition of creativity. This definition should explain creativity, establish its link with learning and give examples of what it means to be creative. You have to be able to create a video that is no longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds and it must include all the above information. Share this with your classmates through a short video Flipgrid.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Earn a Badge</h3>

                <p>Visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://diy.org"> Kids Learning Skills and Being Awesome</a> website. Sign-in using your username and password that has been provided by your teacher. </p>

                <p>Take a few minutes and explore this new learning space where you will be able to discover new passions, develop new skills and share your experiences with others. </p>

                <p>Now that you have explored this website, go through the navigation bar and pick a new skill you wish to work on. To do this, click on the word PATCHES located at the top navigation bar. On this page, you will have a list of skill topics you can choose from. Explore and pick a skill that you have NEVER tried before. Each skill has several challenges from which to choose. You will have one week to complete as many challenges as you can within that skill set.</p>

                <h3>4. New Challenge Idea</h3>

                <p>Now that you have explored a new skill, it is time to reflect on your learning. As you were completing the challenges, did new ideas come to mind? Were you inspired by these challenges and the ideas of others? Come up with a new challenge idea that falls within this skill set. Analyze how this connects to your skill and other challenges you have completed. Explain how this idea is unique and creative. Using <a target="_blank" href="https://flipgrid.com/96d543">Flipgrid</a>, create a video of 1 minute and 30 seconds to share your challenge, your analysis and your explanation.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Peer-Evaluation</h3>
                <p>Select the videos on <a target="_blank" href="https://flipgrid.com/96d543">Flipgrid</a>of two of your peers and watch them one at a time. After watching each one, evaluate the idea presented using the following criteria.</p>
                <p>Was the idea unique and creative?</p>
                <p>Was it related to the skill?</p>
                <p>What should the creator consider when developing this challenge?</p>

                <p>Post a comment to the person’s video with the answer to these questions. Support your answers and be as detailed as possible to help your peer in the development of their project.</p>

                <h3>6. Submit Your Completed Policy Brief Document for a Grade</h3>

                <p>Create your challenge. Keep in mind the feedback provided by your peers while completing this project as it could help improve your final product. Submit your project in two places: </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>In the portfolio section of the <a target="_blank" href="https://diy.org"> Kids Learning Skills and Being Awesome</a> website.</li>
                    <li>Share this video with your teacher to be graded.</li>
                </ol>
