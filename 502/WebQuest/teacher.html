                <p>Welcome to the WebQuest lesson plan on creativity. This page is designated to educators who wish to see in greater detail the purpose, objectives and learner characteristics associated to this WebQuest. </p>

                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>The WebQuest was designed to help you to better understand and develop your understanding and application of creativity and the creative process. These series of tasks promote students to use and to build on a new set of skills in order to further push their imagination in a new direction, and get their creative juices flowing. Building from one idea, in this case challenge, to create another idea. To help the students learn a new skill, the online platform Kids Learning Skills and Being Awesome is used. This website is already set up to inspire children 16 and under to try out a new skill and accumulate points to earn a badge by completing challenges.
                </p>

                <h3>Rationale</h3>
                <p>For nearly two decades, a downfall in creative abilities is more apparent than ever in today’s adults and students. Research papers such as, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ideatovalue.com/crea/khkim/2017/04/creativity-crisis-getting-worse/">The Creativity Crisis: The Decrease in Creative Thinking Scores on the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking</a> by Dr. Kyung Hee Kim, a Professor at The College of William and Mary, explains in more detail this phenomenon. Since the 1990, a shift towards test-taking skills became a priority for the American Politiciens. The political push occurred do to a fear to stay on top of academic educational and economic success seen in other neighboring Asian Countries.
                </p>

                <p>Reintroducing the creative process in the classroom is more important now than ever. It is part of the top skills required in today's workforce. It is also present in our educational standards linked to innovation. We are born will the natural abilities to be creative, but as many other skills, this needs to be practiced as it too can become obsolete if not used and developed. Targeting specific training, the creative area is a need not only for today’s student but also for today’s teacher.
