<h2>
	Web Accessibility for the Visually-Impaired and Blind
	</h2>
<p>
	The World Wide Web allows access to an unimaginable amount of information through a variety of web resources. These sources should be equally accessible to people with a variety of physical and cognitive abilities. Web Accessibility focuses on removing barriers of communication between the web and its users. This allows everyone to access, view, interact, navigate and, more importantly, contribute to the Web.
	</p>
<p>
	Imagine yourself trying to navigate through the World Wide Web with your eyes closed. According to the <a href="https://nfb.org/fact-sheet-blindness-and-low-vision">National Federation of the Blind</a>, it is "estimated that as many as 10 million Americans are blind or visually-impaired" and that "each year 75,000 more people become blind or visually-impaired". 
	The <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility#wai"> Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a> has made it their mission to lead the Web to its full potential and ensure that people with disabilities have the same opportunities to actively participate on the Web. Without specialized software or applications, this task would be nearly impossible for these individuals. A valuable tool that can assist these individuals to this end is a screen reader.
	</p>
		
<p>
	Screen Readers are software programs or applications that can read the text on a webpage aloud to increase web accessibility. Furthermore, many of these assistive softwares can read or spell out individual words as well as tell the user which keyboard keys have been pressed. For more information, visit the 
	<a href="http://www.afb.org/prodBrowseCatResults.aspx?CatID=49">American Foundation for the Blind</a>'s description or view this <a href="https://youtu.be/o_mvO6EQ0tM">Introduction to Screen Readers</a> video .
