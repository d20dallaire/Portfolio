            <p>The website below is intended for educators considering the integration of game-based or virtual world learning in their classroom. The following information focuses on making these environments successful through the application of game personality types.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitles">General Overview</h2>
            <p>Gaming can be implemented in the classroom in order to increase student engagement. There are many platforms that exist, both on and offline, and it is possible to create your own. However, the effectiveness of these games must take into consideration the motivational strategies of different types of personalities to be successful.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitles"> Today’s Digital Learners </h2>
            <p>
                Any child born today or who is currently in school is a digital learner, also referred to as a digital native. These individuals know what it means to grow up in an environment surrounded by technology and everything it has to offer. Unfortunately, technology is not always used in the way children are used to and this means there is a huge untapped potential: online games, such as massively multiplayer online (MMO) or massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG).
            </p>
            <p>
                More and more research can prove that our children spend equal time or more in online games than they do attending school. We, as teachers, should be questioning why they spend so much time gaming and how we can utilize this to educate them. We need to bring digital learning to our classrooms in a meaningful way.

            <h2 class="subtitles shorter"> The Bartle Test </h2>
            <p>
                What motivates you to play? The taxonomy of player type, the Bartle Test, was first explored in a university paper written in 1996 by Richard Bartle.</p>
            <p>
                Through observation and inquiry, Bartle found a series of patterns that motivated different gamers to play. He summarized these observations into four main classifications: achiever, explorer, socializer and killer. Many game designers take these into consideration when designing a game to ensure engagement for all types of personalities.
            </p>
            <p>
                A successful game-based learning environment depends upon student motivation. Since different personality types are motivated in unique ways, we need to make sure our game design encourages everyone to be inspired. This means our activities and lessons have to reflect an understanding of all these strategies.

            <h2 class="subtitles shorter"> Personalities </h2>

            <p><span class="types">Achiever</span>
                <br /> An achiever is focused on completing games, beyond the main mission, and perfecting their game-play to gain all possible achievements.
            </p>

            <p><span class="types"> Explorer </span>
                <br /> An explorer’s goal is to discover new ideas that may or may not have been intended by the game designer. The player enjoys interacting with the created world.
            </p>

            <p><span class="types"> Socializer </span>
                <br /> A socializer prefers interacting with other players or non-playable characters (NPCs). These players tend to help others in game or on social media platforms.
            </p>

            <p><span class="types"> Killer </span>
                <br /> A killer focuses on exerting dominance or creating chaos for other players. This player enjoys disrupting regular game-play.
            </p>
