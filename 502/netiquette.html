	<h2><span class="firstLetter">S</span>tick to people you know.</h2>
	<p class="subtext">Speaking to strangers online can be as dangerous as it is in person. Always make sure to stay safe by playing or speaking online with a friend or family member you have met in person before. If you feel uncertain, make sure to ask an adult for help. It is even more important to make sure that you never meet in person with someone that you have only interacted with online.</p></div>
	
	<div class="contentItem">
		<h2><span class="firstLetter">N</span>ever give away your personal information.</h2>
  	<p class="subtext">When playing games or speaking to someone online, there is a lot of information that can be shared, but some of it shouldn't be. Never share information that can easily identify you. Examples of this include: your name, your address, your phone number, your school, your birthday and your age.<br /><br />
	★ One trick is to create a pseudonym. This is a made-up name that no one can identify as being you. Remember: this name should not be someone you know. An example of a pseudonym is LittleFish3.<br /><br />
    ★ Also, you should never share when you or your parents are away on vacation as this can tell someone that there is an empty house.</p></div>
	
	<div class="contentItem">
		<h2><span class="firstLetter">B</span>e friendly and kind online.</h2>
	<p class="subtext">When you are online, you want to remember to treat other people with kindness and respect, as you would in the real world. Would you call your friends names on the playground? Would you destroy something that someone built? If you answered no to those questions, then you should follow that same code of ethics when you're online.<br />
    <br />
    ★ Sometimes, our friends can say or do mean things online, even though they shouldn't. You should never act unkindly in return. Instead, speak to an adult about how to solve this problem while showing good Netiquette.</p></div>
	
	<div class="contentItem">
		<h2><span class="firstLetter">O</span>nly do things that are appropriate for you.</h2>
 	<p class="subtext">The Internet is a rich environment for people of all ages. Because of this, you have to be careful to play games or visit websites that are appropriate for your age. If you are uncertain or find something that upsets you in any way, remember to speak to an adult.</p></div>
	
	<div class="contentItem">
		<h2><span class="firstLetter">A</span>lways come up with a strong password and never share it with anyone.</h2>
	<p class="subtext">Your password protects all your information and should be strong and kept safe. A strong password should include capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It should be easy for you to remember, but not easy for someone to guess. You should never write it down or share your password with anyone, except for your parents. Would your parents share their bank account password with someone else? The answer is no, so the same rule should apply to all your accounts with passwords.</p></div>
